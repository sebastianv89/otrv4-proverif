(* Model of OTRv4
 * Sebastian R. Verschoor
 *
 * This model aims to prove online deniability for Alice in the setting of the
 * interactive handshake.
 *
 * *Online deniability* [means][DAKES] that
 * > participants [...] cannot provide proof of participation to third parties
 * > without making themselves vulnerable to KCI attacks, even if they perform
 * > artibtrary protocols with these third parties during the exchange".
 * Key compromise impersonation (KCI) implies that the long-term keys of an
 * honest or coerced party have been compromised. Here we aim to prove a
 * slightly weaker statement: an attacker without access to Bob's long-term
 * keys cannot provide evidence that Alice participated in a conversation.
 * This is mainly a technical distinction, because it does not *prove* that
 * the adversary can perform KCI with Bob's long-term key, but that part can
 * be easily seen and does not require formal modelling.
 * 
 * We cannot model arbitrary protocols, but we can model something pretty
 * close: Bob will sign arbitrary messages with his long-term private key and
 * Bob will do arbitrary DH computations with his long-term private key.
 * That way we don't explicitly model Bob, but instead provide the attacker
 * with all they need and more to execute Bob's half of the protocol.
 *
 * TODO: does online deniability imply offline deniability
 *
 * # Inaccuracies of the model
 *
 * Proverif is based on the pi-calculus and can only do so much to accurately
 * model the protocol and cryptographic primitives as specified (let alone
 * implemented). In particular, Proverif assumes perfect cryptographic
 * primitives and cannot handle associativity, but for a more complete
 * discussion of the matter see the [Proverif manual][Proverif]. This is
 * relevant for OTRv4 in at least the following ways:
 * - Diffie-Hellman is only defined relative to the base element.
 * - Hashes (also MAC and KDF) are essentialy random oracles.
 *
 * Besides the above unavoidable sources of incompleteness, there are also some
 * diversions from the protocol as [currently specified][OTRv4]:
 * - protocol negotiation/modes: it is assumed that Alice and Bob have agreed
 *   on this beforehand. Downgrade attacks, for example, are not covered.
 * - nested KDF calls are avoided
 * - I modelled [this proposal](https://github.com/otrv4/otrv4/issues/205)
 *   (since I have only modelled the handshake, that means that I simply did
 *   not include additional ephemeral keys)
 *   FIXME: this should be done differently
 * - Fingerprint comparison must be modelled at a particular point in time,
 *   here done just after the regular protocol completes. In reality, it
 *   can be done at any time (preferably beforehand). The alternative (SMP) has
 *   not been modelled.
 *   FIXME: this probably must be done earlier
 *
 * Some things may look strange but they should not affect the results:
 * - public data (Client-/Prekey-Profiles) are outputted only once
 * - new values are generated as early as possible, this helps Proverif
 *   resolve the model quicker. In general the order of operations does not
 *   matter, only the order of sent/received messages.
 * - signatures are implemented with message recovery directly from the signature.
 *   This should improve Proverif performance and does not affect the model since
 *   signatures are always computed over publicly known values.
 * - SSID values can be compared, but this is not required to be confidential,
 *   this is modelled by simply outputting the value (but actual comparison is
 *   considered out of scope).
